**PatternsOfRandomness** is an experimental Internet art project that blends randomized visuals with a procedurally generated melody. It‚Äôs an evolving experience that explores the balance between **familiarity and uniqueness**, where each session offers new patterns while maintaining recurring elements that provide a sense of coherence.

By interacting with the page, viewers trigger a flow of swirling shapes and shifting tones that evolve continuously. No two experiences are the same, yet there is enough repetition to feel familiar, resulting in a dynamic and captivating interplay between chaos and order.

## üé® Concept

The project emphasizes the beauty found in randomness. Through random, ever-shifting visuals and melodies, **PatternsOfRandomness** conveys how repetition and novelty can coexist. The visual continuously evolves, with each session offering a new arrangement while retaining recognizable patterns. Similarly, the procedural music evolves with each loop but maintains recurring motifs, creating a blend of the known and the unexpected.

**Key Features**:
- **Randomized Visuals**: Constantly moving and changing shapes that exhibit patterns of both familiarity and uniqueness. Shapes vary in size, position, and color with every session.
- **Procedural Music**: A continuous generative melody that evolves with subtle variations in each loop while retaining recurring harmonic patterns, providing both novelty and consistency.
- **Interactive Start**: The experience begins upon user interaction (touch or click), synchronizing the start of the visuals and music.

## üìÇ Project Overview

The project is built using HTML5 Canvas for rendering the dynamic visuals and the Web Audio API to generate the melody. Together, they create an evolving audiovisual loop.

### Key Components:
- **`index.html`**: The core HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage, as well as the JavaScript that handles the procedural visuals and melody generation.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: Used for drawing continuously moving and evolving shapes, ensuring a constantly shifting visual experience.
- **Web Audio API**: Handles the procedural generation of the melody, ensuring the music evolves smoothly without pauses between loops.

## üöÄ Running the Project

To run **PatternsOfRandomness** locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mwhatter/PatternsOfRandomness.git
   ```

2. **Open `index.html`** in any modern browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

3. **Interact with the screen** to start the experience. The visuals and audio will begin in sync once the user clicks or taps the screen.

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

The project offers several opportunities for customization to alter the visuals and sounds:

- **Shape Patterns**:
  - Modify the number of shapes, speed, and movement by tweaking the `generateRandomShapes()` and `updateShapes()` functions in the JavaScript.
  - Adjust the colors, transparency, and behaviors in the `drawPsychedelicVisual()` function to explore different visual styles.

- **Melody**:
  - Customize the musical scale, tempo, and randomness of the melody by changing `noteFrequencies`, `tempo`, and note duration choices in the `catchyMelody()` function.

## üí° Inspiration

**PatternsOfRandomness** is inspired by the intersection of randomness and structure. It draws from elements of both psychedelic art and avant-garde music, embracing the balance between familiar repetition and unexpected novelty. The project showcases how randomness can create recurring patterns while also introducing constant newness, resulting in a mesmerizing audiovisual experience.
